# Compile

- Install node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Clone the repository
- Run npm install
- Run node index.js
- You can also run "pkg . --target node14-win-x64" to make your own .exe file. (No Linux / MacOS support) 

Status now shows up, the command prompt hides itself after it sets up, and becomes a tray application.
